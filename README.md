My first Angular 2 project, using SCSS & Webpack, for Celerity.  For the moment, this is not using Angular as much as I would like.  It's all just smashed into 1 gigantic html file, but it would be better if it could use multiple components, pulling in multiple templates and scss files for each component.  It's on the TODO list!

First run...
```
npm install
```

Second build and run server with...
```
npm start
```

will be running on localhost:8080
